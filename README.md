## Code review
- I had a couple of issues trying to get the lines under the links to disappear in codepen
- Jaypee (John Paul) told me where to put "text-decoration: none;" code and it worked so he was a big help cause I was trying to figure it out for like 3 hours
- Well I learned where to place "text-decoration" code for next time
